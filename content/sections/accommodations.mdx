## Where do I stay?

We have a couple hotel blocks at a discounted rate to choose from!

### The Cheshire Cat Inn & Cottages

🛎️ A quaint California B&B, located inland from the ocean, and walking distance to downtown Santa Barbara. This will be our main hub and where we will be staying.

- You must call to book a room. Simply mention “Lian and Colin’s Wedding” block.
- All rooms are unique, so browse the site and choose your favorite (although you’ll need to call to check if it’s available).
- In addition to the standard rooms, the inn has a handful of 2-bed, 1-bath cottages.
- If you want to extend your stay, you’ll receive a small discount on any additional nights booked.

### The Upham Hotel

🌳 This historic, Victorian B&B is just a few blocks from the Cheshire!

- Like the Cheshire, you must call to book a room and mention “Lian and Colin’s Wedding” block.
- Not all rooms listed online are in the block, so we recommend calling to check availability.
- If no more rooms are available, just let us know — we can always add more.

### Other Recommendations

We understand Santa Barbara can get quite expensive to visit, especially in the summer months. Please feel free to look into alternative accommodations if need be! Again, just keep in mind that there is no parking at the venue so you may need to meet at one of our shuttle stops. Some places we recommend are:

1. Airbnb
1. Vrbo

🐚 If you just want to be closer to the ocean, we highly recommend:

1. Harbor View Inn
