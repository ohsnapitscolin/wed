### Attire

<u>🍷 Welcome Drinks</u>

Dressy Casual. Dress like you're heading out to dinner!

<u>💍 Wedding</u>

Semi-Formal. Think classy, comfortable, and colorful. Have a fun outfit you never get to wear? Do it! We’ll be outdoors in California, so prepare for late afternoon sun and a cooler evening breeze. Suits and ties encouraged. If you’re confused, text us.
