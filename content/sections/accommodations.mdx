## Where do I stay?

We have a couple hotel blocks in downtown Santa Barbara (at a discounted rate) to choose from! These blocks are for Friday and Saturday night.

### The Cheshire Cat Inn & Cottages

🛎️ A quaint California B&B, located inland from the ocean. This is where the bridal party will be staying — so the standard rooms are all filled up, but we do have a handful of [2-bed, 1-bath cottages](https://cheshirecat.com/accommodations/cottages) available. Each cottage has a small kitchen and patio.

- You must call to book. Simply mention “Lian and Colin’s Wedding.”
- If you want to extend your stay outside of our block, you’ll receive a small discount on any additional nights booked.

### The Upham Hotel

🌳 This historic, Victorian B&B is walking distance to downtown Santa Barbara and just a few blocks from The Cheshire. Some more details:

- Like the Cheshire, you must call to book a room and mention “Lian and Colin’s Wedding.”
- Not all rooms listed online are in the block, so we recommend calling to check availability.
- If no more rooms are available, just let us know — we can always add more.
- If you want to extend your stay outside our block, you’ll receive a small discount on any additional nights booked.

### The Harbor View Inn

🐚 If you just want to be closer to the ocean and downtown Santa Barbara, we recommend this hotel!

- Unfortunately, the Harbor View does not offer discounted room blocks during the popular summer months.
- It's a tad pricier here, but still a great option during peak season in Santa Barbara.
