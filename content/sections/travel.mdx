## How do I travel there?

✈️ Santa Barbara has a small airport that connects to many major cities! It is about a 15-20 minute drive to our hotel blocks/downtown.

🚗 Santa Barbara is also located about 2 hours north of Los Angeles. If it’s easier to fly into LAX, you could rent a car or take the [Santa Barbara Airbus](https://www.sbairbus.com), which picks up from the terminals at various times between 8am-10pm daily.
